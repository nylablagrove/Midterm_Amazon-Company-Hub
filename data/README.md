# Data Files (Not Included)

The full datasets used for this project are too large to upload to GitHub.  
They can be found locally on the project machine and should be placed in the same folder as `final_app.py`.

**Expected files:**
| File name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| amazon_sales_with_two_months.csv | Two months of Amazon product sales data with discounts, ratings, and categories |
| amazon_reviews.csv | Text reviews with sentiment and keyword fields |
| amazon_products.csv | Product metadata (title, price, category) |

⚠️ To run the Streamlit app locally:
1. Place these CSVs in the same directory as `final_app.py`
2. Then run:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run final_app.py
